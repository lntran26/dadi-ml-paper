Quality check for data/test_100_theta_100_ns200:
Number of FS with at least one negative entry: 49
Number of FS with at least one NaN entry: 0
Number of FS with at least one pos inf entry: 0

Note: Negative entries in FS reported above were automatically converted to its absolute value as part of the pipeline processing.
Any FS with negative entries sum to more than 0.1% of the sum of all entries in FS before conversion will be reported below.
To reduce the number of FS with negative entries in initial simulations try increasing the grids size.
